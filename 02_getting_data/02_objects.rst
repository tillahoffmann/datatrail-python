Objects in Python
=================

What is an Object?
------------------

An object in Python is something that contains information and, sometimes, performs actions. For example, numbers, strings, and tables are all objects of different *types*.

Storing Objects
---------------

In Python, as with all programming languages, it is important to be able to store objects that we create so that we can use them later. The process of storing an object is called *assignment*, and it entails giving an object a name. For example, the following code creates an object called :code:`min_age` and stores inside that object the value 21.

>>> min_age = 21

The :code:`=` operator is called the assignment operator. After you run this code by pressing :kbd:`Shift-Enter`, Python will keep track of the :code:`min_age` variable. You can verify that the variable exists by clicking the :kbd:`üêû` button on the left of the toolbar, and :code:`min_age` will appear in the list of variables.

Retrieving Objects
------------------

Now if we ask Python to evaluate :code:`min_age`, it will return the number 21 to us.

>>> min_age
21

Having this minimum age variable stored in an object can be useful later if we have data where we only want to keep individuals who exceed this minimum age.

Object Types
------------

Every object in Python has a type, and you'll often work with the following types:

- Strings, e.g., :code:`"sharon"` or :code:`"marcus"`.
- Integers (whole numbers), e.g., :code:`4` or :code:`7`.
- Floats (decimal numbers), e.g., :code:`1.2` or :code:`3.4`.
- Logical which can take only two values :code:`True` and :code:`False`.
- Lists, e.g., :code:`[1, 2, 3]`.
- Dictionaries, e.g., :code:`{"negative number": -1, "positive_number": 2}`.

We will describe each of these types in more detail. But first, why are these important anyway?

Why are Types Important?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's discuss an example. Suppose we asked "What is :code:`blue` divided by :code:`2`?" You would rightly tell us that the question doesn't even make sense, and you can't answer it.

Suppose instead we asked "What is :code:`4` divided by :code:`2`?" You could easily tell us :code:`4 / 2 = 2`. In the same way, Python will raise errors if we ask it nonsensical questions or things that it is not built to do.

We therefore need to keep an eye on what data types we have and what we are asking Python to do so they make sense together.

Strings
^^^^^^^

String objects in Python can be created by surrounding a string in either double quotes or single quotes. The example below shows how to store the above sentence object in an object named :code:`my_str`. :code:`my_str` is a string of length 27, i.e., it has 27 individual characters.

>>> my_str = "This is a character object."
>>> len(my_str)
27

Integers
^^^^^^^^

Integers are whole numbers, such as 1, 23, or 1000.  1.2 is not an integer because it contains a fraction of a number. The following creates an integer object called :code:`num` and stores the value 42.

>>> num = 42

Floats
^^^^^^

Floats (short for "floating point objects") represent real numbers and are created by entering a number that contains a decimal marker :code:`.`. Thus, while 1.2 is not an integer, it is a real number. Thus 1.2 could be stored as a numeric but not an integer.

>>> num2 = 1.2

As discussed previously, we can also use Python as calculator. In the console, we can enter mathematical expressions without assignment to display the results as a calculator would. The *operators* for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation in Python are :code:`+`, :code:`-`, :code:`*`, :code:`/`, and :code:`**`, respectively.

>>> 1 + 5
6
>>> 2 - 3
-1
>>> 4 * 2
8
>>> 4 / 5
0.8
>>> 3 ** 2
9

Bools
^^^^^

Bools in Python represent true or false conditions and can be created by typing :code:`True` or :code:`False`.

>>> check_condition = True
>>> other_check_condition = False

Lists
^^^^^

Lists are ordered collections of items and can be created by wrapping the items in brackets :code:`[]` separated by commas. Lists can contain objects of different types. They are often used to store data, such as the ages of people in a dataset.

>>> my_list = [1, "red", 17.5, "hello"]

Lists can be *indexed* with brackets to retrieve one or more items. Indexing in Python is "zero-based", i.e., the first element has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on. This may seem counterintuitive at first, but zero-based indexing makes dealing with indices easier in the long run. Indexing with :code:`1` thus returns the second element in the list.

>>> my_list[1]
'red'

You can also use so-called *slicing* to retrieve multiple elements at once. Slicing indexes the list with two numbers: :code:`start:end`. This will get all objects in the list between :code:`start` and :code:`end`; both numbers are optional. Here are a few examples.

Get all objects *after* the second element.

>>> my_list[2:]
[17.5, 'hello']

Get all numbers *after* the first up to and including the third element.

>>> my_list[1:3]
['red', 17.5]

Slicing is *inclusive* on the left. That means the first element of a slice is the same as if you had indexed with :code:`start`.

>>> my_list[2:]
[17.5, 'hello']
>>> my_list[2]
17.5

However, slicing is *exclusive* on the right. That means the last element of a slice *is not* the same as if you had indexed with :code:`end`.

>>> my_list[:2]
[1, 'red']
>>> my_list[2]
17.5

This can be confusing but has its benefits. For example, it makes it easy to calculate how many elements the result has. The sliced list :code:`my_list[start:end]` has :code:`end - start` elements.


Dictionaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dictionaries, just like real-world dictionaries, allow you to look things up. They are created by wrapping key-value pairs in braces :code:`{}` separated by commas.

>>> definitions = {
...     "Python": "a programming language",
...     "data science": "the study of data to extract insights",
... }

The object to the left of the colon is called the *key* and the one to the right of the colon the *value*. Together, they form a key-value pair. Like lists, dictionaries can be indexed by one of its keys.

>>> definitions["Python"]
'a programming language'

Keys must be unique, but the same value may appear multiple times.

.. note::

    Need to include information on categorical data types (such as pandas.Categorical) and pandas data frames, but they are not "builtin" and may deserve a dedicated page in the Python version of the course.

Determining the Type of an Object
---------------------------------

We have discussed how to create objects of different types in Python. We haven't yet described how to determine the type of an object once its been stored. To do so, there are three different strategies we'll show you.

1. You can use the function :code:`type` and specify the object in the parentheses.

>>> min_age = 21
>>> type(min_age)
<class 'int'>

>>> min_age = 21.5
>>> type(min_age)
<class 'float'>

>>> color = "red"
>>> type(color)
<class 'str'>

>>> colors = ["red", "blue"]
>>> type(colors)
<class 'list'>

>>> alphabet = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
>>> type(alphabet)
<class 'dict'>

2. You can use the :code:`print` function to print the value of the object or simply evaluate the object.

>>> print(color)
red
>>> color
'red'

The second line includes quotation marks which indices that :code:`color` is a string. Generally, using :code:`print` gives prettier, more readable results. But evaluating the object directly provides more information.

3. Lastly, you can always look at the "Variables" panel in the right panel (make sure you've activated the inspector by clicking :kbd:`üêû`). This approach doesn't require you to run any command, but sometimes it won't have information the other two approaches can tell you.

Summary
-------

In this lesson, we've discussed that information can be assigned to objects. We've covered the five main types of objects in Python, and we will discuss this in greater detail in later lessons in the course. We've discussed how to create each type of object in Python as well as each type's unique properties. Finally, we discussed how to determine the type of an object in Python using the function :code:`type`.
